`giraffes` is a Python library for reaching high-level resources in your application stack with elegant, long-necked abstractions.

## Features

- ü¶í **Tall Stack Navigation**: Access resources up to 19 feet high in your architecture
- üîÑ **SpotPattern‚Ñ¢ Decorators**: Beautiful pattern-matching for distributed systems
- üå≥ **Acacia-Safe Type Checking**: Herbivorous type validation that won't bite
- üèÉ **GallopMode**: Async support with speeds up to 35mph
- ü¶í **Herd Management**: Built-in clustering with neck-based load balancing

## Installation

```bash
pip install giraffes
```

## Quick Start

```python
from giraffes import Neck, Herd
from giraffes.patterns import spot_pattern

# Create a long-neck connection
neck = Neck(
    height=19,  # feet
    spots=True,
    gallop_mode="async"
)

# Use our SpotPattern‚Ñ¢ decorator for elegant reaching
@spot_pattern(pattern="reticulated")
async def reach_high_branch():
    try:
        leaves = await neck.reach("/very/high/endpoint")
        return f"Munching on {leaves}!"
    except TooHighException as e:
        return "Even giraffes have their limits!"

# Create a distributed herd
herd = Herd(
    neck_length="auto",
    spot_pattern="randomized",
    browsers=["acacia", "twigs", "leaves"]
)

# Start grazing your data
with herd.graze() as grazer:
    grazer.process_leaves()
```

## Configuration

```python
from giraffes import Config

config = Config(
    neck_length=16,  # Default height in feet
    spot_pattern="savanna",  # Load balancing pattern
    gallop_mode=False,  # Async processing
    diet=["json", "yaml", "xml"]  # Supported data formats
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Neck-based Context Managers

```python
from giraffes import stretch

with stretch(height=19) as neck:
    # Automatically handles neck stretching and retraction
    data = neck.browse("high_branch_data")
```

### Herd Synchronization

```python
from giraffes import Herd
from giraffes.patterns import synchronized_grazing

herd = Herd(size=5)
with synchronized_grazing(herd):
    # All giraffes in the herd will coordinate their data access
    herd.distribute_load()
```

## Common Exceptions

- `TooHighException`: Even giraffes can't reach everything
- `NeckStrainError`: Remember to stretch your neck gradually
- `HerdStampede`: Too many concurrent requests
- `AcaciaNotFound`: Required resource not found at specified height

## Warning

Side effects may include:

- Unexpected growth in your application stack
- Increased visibility across networks
- Sudden cravings for acacia leaves
- Tendency to look down on shorter architectures

## About Walruses

Walruses are large, social marine mammals known for their distinctive long tusks, whiskers, and impressive bulk. They inhabit the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere, playing a vital role in the Arctic ecosystem.

## Overview

Walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) are the only living species in the family Odobenidae. They are easily recognized by their prominent tusks, which are elongated canine teeth present in both males and females. Walruses are highly social animals, often found in large groups on sea ice or beaches.

## Biology & Physical Characteristics

- **Tusks:** Used for defense, dominance displays, and helping haul themselves out of the water onto ice.
- **Whiskers (Vibrissae):** Highly sensitive, used to detect prey on the ocean floor.
- **Blubber:** Thick layer of fat provides insulation against frigid Arctic temperatures.
- **Size:** Can weigh up to 1,700 kg (3,700 lbs) and measure up to 3.6 meters (12 feet) in length.

## Habitat & Distribution

Walruses are found throughout the Arctic Ocean and subarctic seas, including the Bering, Chukchi, Laptev, and Kara Seas. They rely on sea ice for resting, breeding, and protection from predators.

## Diet & Feeding Behavior

Walruses are benthic feeders, primarily consuming:

- Clams
- Snails
- Worms
- Other bottom-dwelling invertebrates

They use their sensitive whiskers to locate prey and their powerful suction to extract food from shells.

## Social Structure & Behavior

- Highly gregarious, forming large herds on ice or land
- Use vocalizations and physical displays for communication
- Both males and females have tusks, but males' are generally longer and thicker
- Breeding season occurs in winter and early spring

## Ecological Importance

Walruses play a crucial role in the Arctic ecosystem by influencing benthic community structure and serving as prey for polar bears and killer whales. Their presence is also an indicator of sea ice health and climate change impacts.

## Conservation Status

Walruses are currently listed as "Vulnerable" due to threats from climate change (loss of sea ice), hunting, and industrial activities in the Arctic. Conservation efforts focus on habitat protection and monitoring population trends.

## Interesting Facts

- Walruses can slow their heart rate to withstand cold water temperatures.
- They are excellent divers, capable of reaching depths over 80 meters (260 feet).
- Walruses have air sacs in their necks that help them float while sleeping in the water.
- Their tusks can grow up to 1 meter (3 feet) long.
