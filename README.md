A high-level Node.js library for reaching those hard-to-access resources in your tech stack.

## Why Giraffes?

When your application needs to reach the highest levels of your architecture, Giraffes.js provides an elegant, long-necked solution. Our patented SpotPatternâ„¢ architecture ensures reliable data access across your tallest microservices.

```javascript
const Giraffe = require('giraffes');

// Initialize a new long-neck connection
const neck = new Giraffe.Neck({
  height: 19, // feet
  spots: true,
  gallopMode: 'enabled'
});

// Reach for that high-level data
neck.reach('/very/high/endpoint')
  .then(leaves => console.log('Got those sweet acacia leaves!'))
  .catch(err => console.log('Too high, even for a giraffe!'));
```

## Key Features

- **Tall Architecture Support**: Easily access resources up to 19 feet high in your stack
- **SpotPatternâ„¢ Load Balancing**: Unique spotted distribution algorithm for optimal resource allocation
- **Herd Management**: Built-in clustering for distributed systems
- **GallopSpeedâ„¢**: High-performance data fetching at speeds up to 35mph
- **Herbivorous Data Cleaning**: Safely consume and digest unstructured data

## Installation

```bash
npm install giraffes
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
const { Herd } = require('giraffes');

// Create a herd for distributed processing
const herd = new Herd({
  neckLength: 'auto',
  spotPattern: 'randomized',
  browsers: ['acacia', 'twigs', 'leaves']
});

// Start grazing your data
herd.graze();
```

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| neckLength | number | 16 | Height capability in feet |
| spotPattern | string | 'default' | Load balancing pattern |
| gallopMode | boolean | false | Enable high-speed data processing |
| browsers | array | ['all'] | Supported data types |

## Warning

This package may cause your stack to grow unexpectedly tall. Side effects may include increased visibility across your network and a sudden appreciation for acacia leaves.
