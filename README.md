# üê∏ Frogs

Frogs are remarkable amphibians found on every continent except Antarctica. Known for their jumping abilities, croaking calls, and diverse colors, frogs play a vital role in ecosystems around the world.

## Features of Frogs

- üê∏ **Incredible Jumpers**: Frogs can leap many times their body length thanks to powerful hind legs.
- üé∂ **Vocal Variety**: Each species has its own unique call, used for communication and attracting mates.
- üåà **Colorful Diversity**: From bright poison dart frogs to camouflaged tree frogs, their colors serve as warnings or disguise.
- ü•ö **Unique Life Cycle**: Frogs undergo metamorphosis, transforming from aquatic tadpoles to land-dwelling adults.
- üåç **Global Presence**: Found in rainforests, deserts, mountains, and even urban areas.

## Biology & Physical Characteristics

- **Skin**: Frogs have permeable skin that absorbs water and oxygen, making them sensitive to environmental changes.
- **Eyes**: Large, bulging eyes provide a wide field of vision.
- **Tongue**: Sticky and fast, perfect for catching insects.
- **Legs**: Long and muscular for jumping and swimming.
- **Ears**: Visible as circular membranes (tympanum) behind the eyes.

## Habitat & Distribution

Frogs inhabit a wide range of environments:

- Tropical rainforests
- Temperate woodlands
- Grasslands
- Wetlands and ponds
- Deserts (some burrow underground to survive dry periods)

## Diet & Feeding Behavior

Frogs are carnivorous, primarily eating:

- Insects (flies, mosquitoes, beetles)
- Worms
- Spiders
- Small fish (for larger species)

Tadpoles, the larval stage, are usually herbivorous or omnivorous, feeding on algae and plant matter.

## Life Cycle

1. **Egg**: Laid in water or moist environments.
2. **Tadpole**: Aquatic, with gills and a tail.
3. **Metamorphosis**: Develops legs, absorbs tail, and forms lungs.
4. **Adult Frog**: Moves onto land, breathes air, and is ready to reproduce.

## Ecological Importance

- Frogs are both predators and prey, helping control insect populations and serving as food for birds, fish, snakes, and mammals.
- Their permeable skin makes them environmental indicators‚Äîdeclines in frog populations often signal ecosystem problems.

## Conservation Status

Many frog species are threatened by:

- Habitat loss
- Pollution
- Climate change
- Disease (notably chytridiomycosis)

Conservation efforts include habitat protection, captive breeding, and disease research.

## Fun Facts

- Some frogs can freeze solid in winter and thaw in spring!
- The goliath frog of West Africa is the largest, growing up to 32 cm (12.6 in) and weighing over 3 kg (7 lb).
- The wood frog can survive being frozen for weeks.
- Poison dart frogs get their toxins from their diet in the wild.
- Frogs can breathe through their skin as well as their lungs.
