# 🐨 gitStream AI Orchestration Sandbox

Just like how koalas spend 20+ hours a day sleeping efficiently, this sandbox helps us efficiently test gitStream automations.

A playground for experimenting with AI-powered workflows and automation rules.

Fun fact: Koalas have unique fingerprints, just like how each gitStream automation test can have its own unique configuration!

Made with 🌿 (but using git branches instead of eucalyptus)
